### INTRODUCTION

In the early-1990s, when the commercial Internet was still young (!), security was taken seriously by most users. Many thought that increased security provided comfort to paranoid people while most computer professionals realized that security provided some very basic protections that we all needed? Cryptography for the masses barely existed at that time and was certainly not a topic of common discourse. By the turn of the century, of course, the Internet had grown in size and importance so as to be the provider of essential communication between billions of people around the world and is the ubiquitous tool for commerce, social interaction, and the exchange of an increasing amount of personal information â€” and we even have a whole form of currency named for cryptography!

Security and privacy impacts many applications, ranging from secure commerce and payments to private communications and protecting health care information. One essential aspect for secure communications is that of cryptography. But it is important to note that while cryptography is _necessary_ for secure communications, it is not by itself _sufficient_. The reader is advised, then, that the topics covered here only describe the first of many steps necessary for better security in any number of situations.

This paper has two major purposes. The first is to define some of the terms and concepts behind basic cryptographic methods, and to offer a way to compare the myriad cryptographic schemes in use today. The second is to provide some real examples of cryptography in use today. (See [Section A.4](https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html?continueFlag=5df56630de56adc0f34bbcb2d0d23dd1#manual) for some additional commentary on this...)
